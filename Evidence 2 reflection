The class was very confusing in terms of all the commands used. But once you understand it and get it right, it's rewarding. It was also very fast, each class a new topic, new commands and more things to understand. I must say that it cost me a lot of work to understand the class in general, but I was still able to solve the exercises and understand it better. I'm not a fan of programming and I'm not going to study anything related to it, but even so, I think it's great to be able to learn at least the basics because I'm sure it's going to help me for the career I study.
